# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Code Style

This repository uses [`standard`][standard-url] to maintain code style and consistency and to avoid style arguments. `npm test` runs `standard` automatically, so you don't have
to!

## Project Governance

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the
project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a
standard guarded open source project.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-master branches** should be used for ongoing work.
3. **Significant modifications** like API changes should be subject to a **pull request**
   to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. **Pull requests** are *encouraged* for all contributions to solicit feedback but left to
   the discretion of the contributor.

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

### Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-
requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add
or change.
